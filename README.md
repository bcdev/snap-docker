This is a project for the creation of Docker images containing the latest published SNAP version (currently SNAP 12).

UPDATE: As of November 2025, the latest published SNAP version is SNAP 13!

The project is based on an earlier setup for SNAP 8, 
see https://github.com/snap-contrib/docker-snap. 

The main goals are to run Docker containers with SNAP
from cloud environments and to access the corresponding <i>esa_snappy</i> from Jupyter notebooks.

## Accessing and using the docker images

A docker image containing an Ubuntu environment, a Python environment (Python version 3.10), and a SNAP 13 installation with
<i>esa_snappy</i> configured and ready to use can be pulled from

```console
docker pull quay.io/bcdev/snap13_python
```

A docker image with reduced size containing an Ubuntu environment and a SNAP 13 installation (but no Python environment) can be pulled from

```console
docker pull quay.io/bcdev/snap13
```

This image can be used for running the SNAP Desktop GUI inside a Docker container.
