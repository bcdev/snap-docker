[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

This is a project for the creation of docker images containing the latest SNAP version 
together with <i>esa_snappy</i>.

The project shall serve as ongoing evolution of an earlier setup for SNAP 8, 
see https://github.com/snap-contrib/docker-snap. Final goals are to run docker containers with SNAP
from cloud environments and to access the corresponding <i>esa_snappy</i> from Jupyter notebooks.

The project is still in an experimental stage.
